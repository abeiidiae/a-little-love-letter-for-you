My Beloved Jayson,

I just want to take this moment to tell you something that's been on my heart-something I hope will reach the deepest part of you. I know things haven't always been easy. There are days when emotions get too heavy, when misunderstandings slip in between us, and when our own inner battles get in the way of clarity. But even in those moments, please know that my love for you has never wavered. Not even once. 

You see, Jayson, loving someone isn't about expecting perfection-it's about embracing growth, even when it's messy and slow. And I know that change, real change, doesn't happen overnight. It's not a race, and I don't need you to rush just to meet my expectations. What matters to me is your willingness to try, to be better not just for me, but for yourself too. That alone speaks volumes. And for that, I am endlessly proud of you. 

Sometimes, I catch myself being impatient, wanting things to move faster than they should. And I get upset with myself for that-because the last thing I want is to pressure you or make you feel like you're not enough. The truth is, you are more than enough for me. Just your presence, your efforts, even your silence when you're trying to process things-all of that matters to me. All of it is part of why I love you. 

I know we're still learning-how to love better, how to listen more, how to speak gently, and how to carry each other's hearts with care. But the fact that we're doing it together... that's what makes this love so real and so worth fighting for. 

I'm not expecting you to always get it right. I don't need grand gestures or perfect words. All I need is you-your honesty, your effort, your heart. And I promise, I will continue to meet you where you are, with patience in one hand and love in the other. Because I'm not just here for the good days-I'm here for the slow healing, the quiet moments, the honest conversations, and even the tears that remind us we're still learning how to love.

Please never doubt how much I love you. You are not a burden. You are not a collection of mistakes. You are someone I cherish deeply. Someone I want to grow with. Someone I am proud to call mine. 

And when the world gets too loud, when your thoughts begin to spiral, I'll be here-reminding you gently that you are safe with me. That no matter how long it takes, we'll figure this out, hand in hand. I'm not going anywhere.

So Jayson, thank you-for your patience, for trying even when it's hard, and for staying. I love you more than words could ever fully capture. And I'll keep choosing you, in every version, in every season, in every possible way. 

Forever yours, Abigail
